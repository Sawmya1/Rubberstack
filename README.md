This assessment implements automated end-to-end testing for the Rudderstack web application using WebdriverIO and CucumberJS. The test suite covers the full user journey, starting with logging into the application and navigating to the Connections page. It programmatically extracts key configuration details such as the Data Plane URL and the Write Key for the HTTP source by interacting with dynamic UI elements and handling overlays or tooltips that may block user actions.

The automation then sends a test API event to Rudderstack using the extracted credentials, validating the authentication and event ingestion flow. After sending the event, the script navigates to the Webhook destination events tab, ensuring any UI overlays are dismissed to allow reliable element interaction. Finally, it verifies the delivered and failed event counts to confirm successful event processing.

Selectors for all critical elements are managed in a dedicated page object, making the tests maintainable and adaptable to UI changes. The solution demonstrates robust handling of asynchronous UI states, overlays, and authentication, providing a comprehensive validation of Rudderstackâ€™s event delivery pipeline.
